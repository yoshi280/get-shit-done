Research expert best practices and industry conventions for this project's domain.

Investigate:
- Patterns expert practitioners adopt for this type of project (not just what works, but
  what the community has converged on as "the right way" and why)
- Standard naming, organization, and structure conventions from widely-adopted projects and
  official style guides for this stack
- Performance and maintainability patterns proven at scale; distinguish patterns that matter
  at small scale from those that only matter at large scale
- Key "always do / never do" rules for this domain with concrete rationale and the failure
  mode that makes each rule necessary
- Relevant style guides, linting configurations, and automated enforcement tools — include
  the specific rules that matter most for this domain
- Anti-patterns that beginners adopt and experts avoid, including why the anti-pattern feels
  natural and what the correct alternative is
- Code review standards and quality gates used by respected projects in this space

Produce findings with confidence levels. Focus on patterns with broad community adoption,
not personal preference or marginal tooling choices. Cite authoritative sources such as
official documentation, widely-adopted framework guides, or respected open-source projects.
Flag any area where community consensus is weak or actively contested.
