Research the feature landscape and implementation patterns for this project's domain.

Investigate:
- Table stakes features that users expect in this category — what is required for the product
  to feel complete; missing these creates a perception of brokenness, not just incompleteness
- Differentiating features that create competitive advantage for this type of project and
  why they matter to users in this domain
- Anti-features: commonly requested capabilities that seem appealing but introduce
  complexity, maintenance burden, or UX problems disproportionate to their value
- Feature dependency graph: which features require other features to be in place first,
  which features conflict with each other, and which features enhance each other
- MVP boundary: the minimum set of features needed to validate the core concept and what
  specifically makes each MVP feature essential vs. deferrable
- Feature prioritization by user value vs. implementation cost
- How competitors and reference implementations approach key features in this domain

Produce a feature landscape organized by priority tier (table stakes, differentiators, future
consideration). Include explicit MVP definition. Flag features that look simple but are not.
Cite actual products or implementations as examples where available.
