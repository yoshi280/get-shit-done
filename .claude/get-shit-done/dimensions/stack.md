Research the recommended technology stack for this project's domain.

Investigate:
- Core technologies and frameworks that expert practitioners use for this type of project,
  including specific version numbers and why each is the standard choice
- Supporting libraries commonly needed in this domain and the specific use cases that warrant
  each one (not all projects need all libraries)
- Development tooling for this stack (linters, formatters, bundlers, test runners) with
  recommended configuration
- Installation commands for all core and supporting dependencies
- Known version compatibility constraints between packages that cause debugging pain
- What NOT to use: actively warn against outdated, deprecated, or problematic choices with
  the specific failure mode each causes and its recommended replacement
- Alternative stacks and the conditions under which they make more sense than the default
  recommendation

Produce a clear recommended stack with rationale. Distinguish between "use this always" and
"use this when [condition]." Cite official documentation or widely-adopted project conventions
as sources. Flag any package that has known breaking changes between major versions.
