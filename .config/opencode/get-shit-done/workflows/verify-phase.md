<purpose>
Verify phase goal achievement through goal-backward analysis. Check that the codebase delivers what the phase promised, not just that tasks completed.

Executed by a verification subagent spawned from execute-phase.md.
</purpose>

<core_principle>
**Task completion ≠ Goal achievement**

A task "create chat component" can be marked complete when the component is a placeholder. The task was done — but the goal "working chat interface" was not achieved.

Goal-backward verification:
1. What must be TRUE for the goal to be achieved?
2. What must EXIST for those truths to hold?
3. What must be WIRED for those artifacts to function?

Then verify each level against the actual codebase.

<process>

<step name="load_context" priority="first">
Load phase operation context:

```bash
INIT=$(node /Users/thelorax/.config/opencode/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js init phase-op "${PHASE_ARG}")
```

Extract from init JSON: `phase_dir`, `phase_number`, `phase_name`, `has_plans`, `plan_count`.

Then load phase details and list plans/summaries:
```bash
node /Users/thelorax/.config/opencode/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js roadmap get-phase "${phase_number}"
grep -E "^| ${phase_number}" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md 2>/dev/null
ls "$phase_dir"/*-SUMMARY.md "$phase_dir"/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null
```

Extract **phase goal** from ROADMAP.md (the outcome to verify, not tasks) and **requirements** from REQUIREMENTS.md if it exists.
</step>

<step name="establish_must_haves">
**Option A: Must-haves in PLAN frontmatter**

```bash
grep -l "must_haves:" "$PHASE_DIR"/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null
```

If found, extract truths, artifacts (with paths), and key_links (from/to/via).

**Option B: Derive from phase goal**

If no must_haves in frontmatter:
1. State the goal from ROADMAP.md
2. Derive **truths** (3-7 observable behaviors, each testable)
3. Derive **artifacts** (concrete file paths for each truth)
4. Derive **key links** (critical wiring where stubs hide)
5. Document derived must-haves before proceeding
</step>

<step name="verify_truths">
For each observable truth, determine if the codebase enables it.

**Status:** ✓ VERIFIED (all supporting artifacts pass) | ✗ FAILED (artifact missing/stub/unwired) | ? UNCERTAIN (needs human)

For each truth: identify supporting artifacts → check artifact status → check wiring → determine truth status.

**Example:** Truth "User can see existing messages" depends on Chat.tsx (renders), /api/chat GET (provides), Message model (schema). If Chat.tsx is a stub or API returns hardcoded [] → FAILED. If all exist, are substantive, and connected → VERIFIED.
</step>

<step name="verify_artifacts">
For each required artifact, verify three levels:

**Level 1 — Existence:** File/directory exists. If MISSING → record and continue.

**Level 2 — Substantive:** Real implementation, not a stub.
- Line minimums: Component 15+, API route 10+, Hook/util 10+, Schema 5+
- Stub detection: `TODO|FIXME|placeholder|not implemented|coming soon`, empty returns (`return null|return {}|return []`), placeholder content
- Export check: `export (default )?(function|const|class)` exists
- SUBSTANTIVE = adequate length + no stubs + has exports. STUB = too short OR stub patterns OR no exports. PARTIAL = mixed.

**Level 3 — Wired:** Connected to the system.
- Import: `grep -r "import.*$artifact_name" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"` → IMPORTED
- Usage: same grep excluding import lines → USED
- WIRED = imported AND used. ORPHANED = exists but not imported/used. PARTIAL = imported but unused.

| Exists | Substantive | Wired | Status |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ VERIFIED |
| ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ⚠️ ORPHANED |
| ✓ | ✗ | - | ✗ STUB |
| ✗ | - | - | ✗ MISSING |
</step>

<step name="verify_wiring">
Key links are critical connections — if broken, goal fails even with all artifacts present.

| Pattern | Check | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Component → API | fetch/axios call to API path, response used (await/.then/setState) | WIRED / PARTIAL (call but unused response) / NOT_WIRED |
| API → Database | Prisma/DB query on model, result returned via res.json() | WIRED / PARTIAL (query but not returned) / NOT_WIRED |
| Form → Handler | onSubmit with real implementation (fetch/axios/mutate/dispatch), not console.log/empty | WIRED / STUB (log-only/empty) / NOT_WIRED |
| State → Render | useState variable appears in JSX (`{stateVar}` or `{stateVar.property}`) | WIRED / NOT_WIRED |

Record status and evidence for each key link.
</step>

<step name="verify_requirements">
If REQUIREMENTS.md exists:
```bash
grep -E "Phase ${PHASE_NUM}" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md 2>/dev/null
```

For each requirement: parse description → identify supporting truths/artifacts → status: ✓ SATISFIED / ✗ BLOCKED / ? NEEDS HUMAN.
</step>

<step name="scan_antipatterns">
Extract files modified in this phase from SUMMARY.md, scan each:

| Pattern | Search | Severity |
|---------|--------|----------|
| TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK | `grep -n -E "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX\|HACK"` | ⚠️ Warning |
| Placeholder content | `grep -n -iE "placeholder\|coming soon\|will be here"` | 🛑 Blocker |
| Empty returns | `grep -n -E "return null\|return \{\}\|return \[\]\|=> \{\}"` | ⚠️ Warning |
| Log-only functions | Functions containing only console.log | ⚠️ Warning |

Categorize: 🛑 Blocker (prevents goal) | ⚠️ Warning (incomplete) | ℹ️ Info (notable).
</step>

<step name="identify_human_verification">
**Always needs human:** Visual appearance, user flow completion, real-time behavior (WebSocket/SSE), external service integration, performance feel, error message clarity.

**Needs human if uncertain:** Complex wiring grep can't trace, dynamic state-dependent behavior, edge cases.

Format each as: Test Name → What to do → Expected result → Why can't verify programmatically.
</step>

<step name="determine_status">
**passed:** All truths VERIFIED, all artifacts pass levels 1-3, all key links WIRED, no blocker anti-patterns.

**gaps_found:** Any truth FAILED, artifact MISSING/STUB, key link NOT_WIRED, or blocker found.

**human_needed:** All automated checks pass but human verification items remain.

**Score:** `verified_truths / total_truths`
</step>

<step name="generate_fix_plans">
If gaps_found:

1. **Cluster related gaps:** API stub + component unwired → "Wire frontend to backend". Multiple missing → "Complete core implementation". Wiring only → "Connect existing components".

2. **Generate plan per cluster:** Objective, 2-3 tasks (files/action/verify each), re-verify step. Keep focused: single concern per plan.

3. **Order by dependency:** Fix missing → fix stubs → fix wiring → verify.
</step>

<step name="create_report">
```bash
REPORT_PATH="$PHASE_DIR/${PHASE_NUM}-VERIFICATION.md"
```

Fill template sections: frontmatter (phase/timestamp/status/score), goal achievement, artifact table, wiring table, requirements coverage, anti-patterns, human verification, gaps summary, fix plans (if gaps_found), metadata.

See /Users/thelorax/.config/opencode/get-shit-done/templates/verification-report.md for complete template.
</step>

<step name="return_to_orchestrator">
Return status (`passed` | `gaps_found` | `human_needed`), score (N/M must-haves), report path.

If gaps_found: list gaps + recommended fix plan names.
If human_needed: list items requiring human testing.

Orchestrator routes: `passed` → update_roadmap | `gaps_found` → create/execute fixes, re-verify | `human_needed` → present to user.
