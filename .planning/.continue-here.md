<current_state>
GSD fork (`yoshi280/get-shit-done`) is fully synced with upstream through 1.20.3. All branches rebased, pushed, and local install patched with fork additions. PR #610 is open and awaiting review.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Synced fork main with upstream 1.20.0 → 1.20.2 → 1.20.3 (fast-forward merges, pushed)
- Rebased `feat/selectable-research-dimensions` onto 1.20.3 (clean, force-pushed)
- Rebased `fork/multi-provider-routing` onto 1.20.3 (clean, force-pushed)
- Created missing research templates (`BEST-PRACTICES.md`, `DATA-STRUCTURES.md`) and committed to PR branch
- Updated PR #610 description to include template files in Changes table
- Re-applied fork local mods to `~/.claude/get-shit-done/references/` (4 files, path-corrected)
- Verified no file overlap between fork branches and upstream 1.20.1–1.20.3 changes
- Confirmed PR #610 is open, reviewer: glittercowboy, no feedback yet
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- **Periodic upstream sync** — re-run when upstream releases beyond 1.20.3 (todo exists: `2026-02-16-periodic-upstream-sync-for-gsd-fork.md`)
- **Set git identity** in fork clone — still using auto-detected `thelorax@Mac.lan` (todo exists: `2026-02-16-set-git-identity-in-gsd-fork-clone.md`)
- **Switch local install to fork** — currently manual copy of 4 files; full install switch not done (todo exists: `2026-02-16-switch-local-gsd-install-to-fork.md`)
- **PR #610 follow-up** — if merged, delete `feat/selectable-research-dimensions` branch; if rejected, keep rebased in fork
- **Re-apply local mods after any GSD update** — running `npx get-shit-done-cc@latest` or `/gsd:update` will overwrite fork additions
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Manual file copy for local mods instead of full install switch — less disruptive, avoids breaking npx update path while PR is pending
- Path references corrected from OpenCode (`~/.config/opencode/`) to Claude Code (`~/.claude/`) when copying fork mods
- Templates follow existing 4-template pattern: `<template>` block with markdown, then `<guidelines>` block with authoring instructions
</decisions_made>

<context>
The fork exists to hold two things: (1) PR #610 for selectable research dimensions (submitted upstream), and (2) fork-only multi-provider model routing additions. The local GSD install at ~/.claude/get-shit-done/ is the upstream npx install with 4 fork files layered on top manually. This is fragile — any GSD update overwrites the fork files. The long-term fix is either getting PR #610 merged + switching to fork-based install, or using /gsd:reapply-patches if that workflow supports it.

<next_action>
Check PR #610 for review feedback. If upstream releases a new version, re-run the sync (fetch upstream, merge main, rebase both branches, push, re-copy local mods).
