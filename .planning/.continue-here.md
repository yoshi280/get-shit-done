<current_state>
Project fully initialized. Roadmap approved with 5 phases, 22 requirements mapped. No phase work has started. Next step is `/gsd:discuss-phase 1` or `/gsd:plan-phase 1`.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Codebase mapping: 7 documents written to `.planning/codebase/` (STACK, ARCHITECTURE, STRUCTURE, CONVENTIONS, TESTING, INTEGRATIONS, CONCERNS)
- Deep questioning: Identified 3 focus areas — flexible research dimensions, phase iteration/rollback, cross-phase awareness + custom workflows
- PROJECT.md: Brownfield project with 11 validated requirements (existing GSD capabilities) and 10 active requirements
- Config: YOLO mode, standard depth, sequential execution, balanced models, all workflow agents enabled
- Research: 4 parallel researchers (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls) + synthesis. Key findings: meta-prompting is mainstream, rollback = compensating actions not true undo, context leakage is real risk, over-complexity kills 40% of projects
- Requirements: 22 v1 requirements across 6 categories (DIM, ITER, CTX, WF, IDEA, OBS). v2 requirements captured for Claude-inferred dimensions, multi-phase rollback, learning, workflow DSL
- Roadmap: 5 phases approved — (1) Selectable Dimensions + Observability, (2) Idea Capture, (3) Cross-Phase Memory, (4) Phase State Machine, (5) Custom Workflows
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Phase 1: Selectable Research Dimensions + Observability (7 requirements: DIM-01..04, OBS-01..03)
- Phase 2: Idea Capture System (3 requirements: IDEA-01..03)
- Phase 3: Cross-Phase Memory and Context Awareness (4 requirements: CTX-01..04)
- Phase 4: Phase State Machine with Iteration (4 requirements: ITER-01..04)
- Phase 5: Custom Workflow Controls (4 requirements: WF-01..04)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Prototype locally (~/.claude/get-shit-done/), port to fork (~/get-shit-done/) for PRs
- Claude infers dimensions + user edits (v1 = user edits only, v2 = add inference)
- Todos + backlog file for idea capture (different tracking for different idea sizes)
- Multi-provider routing out of scope (separate branch)
- Sequential execution (not parallel) for this project
- Research dimensions first — proves core value prop with minimal complexity
- Phase 2 (idea capture) early because it's independent and low-risk
- Phase 3 before 4 because memory infrastructure needed before rollback can work
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None. PR #610 still awaiting review from glittercowboy but doesn't block Phase 1 work.
</blockers>

<context>
This project improves the GSD meta-prompting framework itself. Development happens in both the fork clone (~/get-shit-done/) and local install (~/.claude/get-shit-done/). The fork has PR #610 for initial selectable dimensions and a separate multi-provider routing branch. Phase 1 builds on PR #610's work to make dimensions user-editable and adds token/cost observability. The codebase map in .planning/codebase/ has detailed analysis of the existing GSD architecture — 7 layers from commands through tools.

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:discuss-phase 1` (or `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to skip discussion) to start building selectable research dimensions + observability. Clear context first with `/clear`.
