# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** GSD agents should accumulate and apply context intelligently — the right research for the right project, and knowledge that persists and compounds across phases.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Selectable Research Dimensions + Observability

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Selectable Research Dimensions + Observability)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-17 — Plan 01 complete (dimension catalog)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 7%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: 0.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-selectable-research-dimensions-observability | 1/3 | 2 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 2 min
- Trend: Not yet established

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Prototype locally, port to fork: Faster iteration without push/pull cycle
- Claude infers dimensions + user edits: Pure user-pick is tedious, pure auto misses domain knowledge
- Todos + backlog file for idea capture: Actionable items need different tracking than big ideas
- Standalone file per dimension (not single catalog): follows GSD file-per-concern pattern, human-editable, project-override-friendly
- Whitelist .claude/get-shit-done/dimensions/ in .gitignore: required to track dimension catalog in git

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
