## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Prototype locally, port to fork: Faster iteration without push/pull cycle
- Claude infers dimensions + user edits: Pure user-pick is tedious, pure auto misses domain knowledge
- Todos + backlog file for idea capture: Actionable items need different tracking than big ideas

### Pending Todos

None yet.
