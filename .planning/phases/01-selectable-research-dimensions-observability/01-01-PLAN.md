<objective>
Create the dimension catalog: 9 standalone Markdown files with YAML frontmatter defining research dimensions.

Purpose: The dimension catalog is the data layer that the selection flow (Plan 02) reads from. Without these files, there is nothing to select. The 4 existing hardcoded dimensions (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls) are migrated from templates/research-project/ into the new standalone format, and 5 new dimensions are added per user decision.

Output: 9 dimension files in ~/.claude/get-shit-done/dimensions/

  <name>Task 1: Create dimension directory and migrate existing 4 dimensions</name>
  <files>
    ~/.claude/get-shit-done/dimensions/stack.md
    ~/.claude/get-shit-done/dimensions/features.md

  </files>
  <action>
    Create the directory ~/.claude/get-shit-done/dimensions/.

    For each of the 4 existing dimensions (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls), create a standalone Markdown file with this structure:

    ```
    ---
    name: {kebab-case-name}
    short_description: {10 words or fewer for checklist display}
    tags: [{relevant tags}]
    suggested_project_types: [{project types where this dimension is useful}]
    ---

    {Research prompt body — the text the researcher agent receives verbatim}
    ```

    Migrate the research prompts from the existing templates in templates/research-project/. Read each template file (STACK.md, FEATURES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, PITFALLS.md) and extract the intent and research guidance from each. Transform them into dimension prompts that work as standalone instructions to a researcher agent.

    The frontmatter fields per the locked decision:
    - `name`: kebab-case, matches filename without .md
    - `short_description`: brief (shown in AskUserQuestion checklist)
    - `tags`: array of category labels
    - `suggested_project_types`: array like [web-app, cli, library, api, mobile, service]

    Specific dimension definitions:

    **stack.md**
    - short_description: "Recommended technologies and library versions"
    - tags: [technologies, libraries, versions, dependencies]
    - suggested_project_types: [web-app, cli, library, api, mobile, service]
    - Body: Instruct researcher to identify core technologies, supporting libraries, dev tools, installation commands, version compatibility, and what NOT to use.

    **features.md**
    - short_description: "Feature patterns and implementation approaches"
    - tags: [features, implementation, patterns, ux]
    - suggested_project_types: [web-app, mobile, api, service]
    - Body: Instruct researcher to investigate feature implementation patterns, UI/UX conventions, data flow approaches, and interaction models for the project domain.

    **architecture.md**
    - short_description: "System design and structural patterns"
    - tags: [architecture, design, structure, organization]
    - suggested_project_types: [web-app, cli, library, api, mobile, service]
    - Body: Instruct researcher to investigate project structure, design patterns, module organization, data flow, state management, and anti-patterns for this domain.

    **pitfalls.md**
    - short_description: "Common mistakes and gotchas to avoid"
    - tags: [pitfalls, mistakes, gotchas, debugging]
    - suggested_project_types: [web-app, cli, library, api, mobile, service]
    - Body: Instruct researcher to catalog common beginner mistakes, rewrite-causing errors, debugging nightmares, configuration pitfalls, and "things I wish I knew" for this domain.

    Each body should be 10-20 lines of clear research guidance with bullet points. Follow the style from the RESEARCH.md code examples in the research document (Pattern 1: Dimension File Format).

    - tags: [patterns, conventions, quality, architecture]
    - suggested_project_types: [web-app, cli, library, api, mobile, service]
    - Body: Use the example from RESEARCH.md Pattern 1 as a starting point. Instruct researcher to investigate expert practitioner patterns, standard naming/organization/structure conventions, performance and maintainability patterns at scale, "always do / never do" rules, style guides and linting configs, and anti-patterns beginners adopt.

    **data-structures.md**
    - short_description: "Data models, schemas, and storage patterns"
    - tags: [data, models, schemas, storage, database]

    - tags: [testing, quality, coverage, automation, ci]
    - suggested_project_types: [web-app, cli, library, api, mobile, service]

    - tags: [deployment, ci-cd, infrastructure, monitoring, hosting]
    - suggested_project_types: [web-app, api, service]

1. ls ~/.claude/get-shit-done/dimensions/ shows exactly 9 .md files
2. Each file starts with --- and has a closing --- (valid frontmatter)
3. Each frontmatter contains: name, short_description, tags, suggested_project_types
4. Each file body is non-empty and contains research guidance
5. Filename matches the `name` field (e.g., stack.md has name: stack)
6. The 4 original dimensions preserve the research intent from templates/research-project/
