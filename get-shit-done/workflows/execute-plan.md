<required_reading>
Read STATE.md before any operation to load project context.
Read config.json for planning behavior settings.

## Load Based on Plan Characteristics

**If plan has checkpoints** (detect with: `grep -q 'type="checkpoint' PLAN.md`):
@~/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-plan-checkpoints.md

**If authentication error encountered during execution:**
@~/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-plan-auth.md

**Deviation handling rules (reference as needed):**
@~/.claude/get-shit-done/references/deviation-rules.md
</conditional_loading>

<process>

<step name="resolve_model_profile" priority="first">
Read model profile for agent spawning:

```bash
MODEL_PROFILE=$(cat .planning/config.json 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"model_profile"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"[^"]*"' | grep -o '"[^"]*"$' | tr -d '"' || echo "balanced")
```

Default to "balanced" if not set.

**Model lookup table:**

| Agent | quality | balanced | budget |
|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| gsd-executor | opus | sonnet | sonnet |

Store resolved model for use in Task calls below.
</step>

<step name="load_project_state">
Before any operation, read project state:

```bash
cat .planning/STATE.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If file exists:** Parse and internalize:

- Current position (phase, plan, status)
- Accumulated decisions (constraints on this execution)
- Blockers/concerns (things to watch for)
- Brief alignment status

**If file missing but .planning/ exists:**

```
STATE.md missing but planning artifacts exist.
Options:
1. Reconstruct from existing artifacts
2. Continue without project state (may lose accumulated context)
```

**If .planning/ doesn't exist:** Error - project not initialized.

This ensures every execution has full project context.

**Load planning config:**

```bash
# Check if planning docs should be committed (default: true)
COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=$(cat .planning/config.json 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"commit_docs"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*[^,}]*' | grep -o 'true\|false' || echo "true")
# Auto-detect gitignored (overrides config)
git check-ignore -q .planning 2>/dev/null && COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=false
```

Store `COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS` for use in git operations.
</step>

<step name="identify_plan">
Find the next plan to execute:
- Check roadmap for "In progress" phase
- Find plans in that phase directory
- Identify first plan without corresponding SUMMARY

```bash
cat .planning/ROADMAP.md
# Look for phase with "In progress" status
# Then find plans in that phase
ls .planning/phases/XX-name/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null | sort
ls .planning/phases/XX-name/*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null | sort
```

**Logic:**

- If `01-01-PLAN.md` exists but `01-01-SUMMARY.md` doesn't → execute 01-01
- If `01-01-SUMMARY.md` exists but `01-02-SUMMARY.md` doesn't → execute 01-02
- Pattern: Find first PLAN file without matching SUMMARY file

**Decimal phase handling:**

Phase directories can be integer or decimal format:

- Integer: `.planning/phases/01-foundation/01-01-PLAN.md`
- Decimal: `.planning/phases/01.1-hotfix/01.1-01-PLAN.md`

Parse phase number from path (handles both formats):

```bash
# Extract phase number (handles XX or XX.Y format)
PHASE=$(echo "$PLAN_PATH" | grep -oE '[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?-[0-9]+')
```

SUMMARY naming follows same pattern:

- Integer: `01-01-SUMMARY.md`
- Decimal: `01.1-01-SUMMARY.md`

Confirm with user if ambiguous.

**Check for checkpoints (determines which workflow extensions to load):**

```bash
HAS_CHECKPOINTS=$(grep -q 'type="checkpoint' .planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md && echo "true" || echo "false")
```

If `HAS_CHECKPOINTS=true`, load execute-plan-checkpoints.md for checkpoint handling logic.

<config-check>
```bash
cat .planning/config.json 2>/dev/null
```
</config-check>

<if mode="yolo">
```
⚡ Auto-approved: Execute {phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md
[Plan X of Y for Phase Z]

```

Proceed directly to load_prompt step.
</if>

<if mode="interactive" OR="custom with gates.execute_next_plan true">
Present:

```
Found plan to execute: {phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md
[Plan X of Y for Phase Z]

Proceed with execution?
```

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.
</if>
</step>

<step name="record_start_time">
Record execution start time for performance tracking:

```bash
PLAN_START_TIME=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
PLAN_START_EPOCH=$(date +%s)
```

Store in shell variables for duration calculation at completion.
</step>

<step name="load_prompt">
Read the plan prompt:
```bash
cat .planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md
```

This IS the execution instructions. Follow it exactly.

**If plan references CONTEXT.md:**
The CONTEXT.md file provides the user's vision for this phase — how they imagine it working, what's essential, and what's out of scope. Honor this context throughout execution.
</step>

<step name="previous_phase_check">
Before executing, check if previous phase had issues:

```bash
# Find previous phase summary
ls .planning/phases/*/SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null | sort -r | head -2 | tail -1
```

If previous phase SUMMARY.md has "Issues Encountered" != "None" or "Next Phase Readiness" mentions blockers:

Use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Previous Issues"
- question: "Previous phase had unresolved items: [summary]. How to proceed?"
- options:
  - "Proceed anyway" - Issues won't block this phase
  - "Address first" - Let's resolve before continuing
  - "Review previous" - Show me the full summary
</step>

<step name="execute">
Execute each task in the prompt. **Deviations are normal** - handle them using deviation rules (see references/deviation-rules.md).

1. Read the @context files listed in the prompt

2. For each task:

   **If `type="auto"`:**

   **Before executing:** Check if task has `tdd="true"` attribute:
   - If yes: Follow TDD execution flow (see `<tdd_execution>`) - RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle with atomic commits per stage
   - If no: Standard implementation

   - Work toward task completion
   - **If CLI/API returns authentication error:** Load execute-plan-auth.md and follow authentication gate protocol
   - **When you discover additional work not in plan:** Apply deviation rules (see references/deviation-rules.md) automatically
   - Continue implementing, applying rules as needed
   - Run the verification
   - Confirm done criteria met
   - **Commit the task** (see `<task_commit>` below)
   - Track task completion and commit hash for Summary documentation
   - Continue to next task

   **If `type="checkpoint:*"`:**

   - STOP immediately (do not continue to next task)
   - Execute checkpoint_protocol (see execute-plan-checkpoints.md)
   - Wait for user response
   - Verify if possible (check files, env vars, etc.)
   - Only after user confirmation: continue to next task

3. Run overall verification checks from `<verification>` section
4. Confirm all success criteria from `<success_criteria>` section met
5. Document all deviations in Summary (see references/deviation-rules.md for documentation format)
</step>

<tdd_plan_execution>
## TDD Plan Execution

When executing a plan with `type: tdd` in frontmatter, follow the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle for the single feature defined in the plan.

**1. Check test infrastructure (if first TDD plan):**
If no test framework configured:
- Detect project type from package.json/requirements.txt/etc.
- Install minimal test framework (Jest, pytest, Go testing, etc.)
- Create test config file
- Verify: run empty test suite
- This is part of the RED phase, not a separate task

**2. RED - Write failing test:**
- Read `<behavior>` element for test specification
- Create test file if doesn't exist (follow project conventions)
- Write test(s) that describe expected behavior
- Run tests - MUST fail (if passes, test is wrong or feature exists)
- Commit: `test({phase}-{plan}): add failing test for [feature]`

**3. GREEN - Implement to pass:**
- Read `<implementation>` element for guidance
- Write minimal code to make test pass
- Run tests - MUST pass
- Commit: `feat({phase}-{plan}): implement [feature]`

**4. REFACTOR (if needed):**
- Clean up code if obvious improvements
- Run tests - MUST still pass
- Commit only if changes made: `refactor({phase}-{plan}): clean up [feature]`

**Commit pattern for TDD plans:**
Each TDD plan produces 2-3 atomic commits:
1. `test({phase}-{plan}): add failing test for X`
2. `feat({phase}-{plan}): implement X`
3. `refactor({phase}-{plan}): clean up X` (optional)

**Error handling:**
- If test doesn't fail in RED phase: Test is wrong or feature already exists. Investigate before proceeding.
- If test doesn't pass in GREEN phase: Debug implementation, keep iterating until green.
- If tests fail in REFACTOR phase: Undo refactor, commit was premature.

**Verification:**
After TDD plan completion, ensure:
- All tests pass
- Test coverage for the new behavior exists
- No unrelated tests broken

**Why TDD uses dedicated plans:** TDD requires 2-3 execution cycles (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR), each with file reads, test runs, and potential debugging. This consumes 40-50% of context for a single feature. Dedicated plans ensure full quality throughout the cycle.

**Comparison:**
- Standard plans: Multiple tasks, 1 commit per task, 2-4 commits total
- TDD plans: Single feature, 2-3 commits for RED/GREEN/REFACTOR cycle

See `~/.claude/get-shit-done/references/tdd.md` for TDD plan structure.
</tdd_plan_execution>

<task_commit>
## Task Commit Protocol

After each task completes (verification passed, done criteria met), commit immediately:

**1. Identify modified files:**

Track files changed during this specific task (not the entire plan):

```bash
git status --short
```

**2. Stage only task-related files:**

Stage each file individually (NEVER use `git add .` or `git add -A`):

```bash
# Example - adjust to actual files modified by this task
git add src/api/auth.ts
git add src/types/user.ts
```

**3. Determine commit type:**

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature, endpoint, component, functionality | feat(08-02): create user registration endpoint |
| `fix` | Bug fix, error correction | fix(08-02): correct email validation regex |
| `test` | Test-only changes (TDD RED phase) | test(08-02): add failing test for password hashing |
| `refactor` | Code cleanup, no behavior change (TDD REFACTOR phase) | refactor(08-02): extract validation to helper |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | perf(08-02): add database index for user lookups |
| `docs` | Documentation changes | docs(08-02): add API endpoint documentation |
| `style` | Formatting, linting fixes | style(08-02): format auth module |
| `chore` | Config, tooling, dependencies | chore(08-02): add bcrypt dependency |

**4. Craft commit message:**

Format: `{type}({phase}-{plan}): {task-name-or-description}`

```bash
git commit -m "{type}({phase}-{plan}): {concise task description}

- {key change 1}
- {key change 2}
- {key change 3}
"
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Standard plan task
git commit -m "feat(08-02): create user registration endpoint

- POST /auth/register validates email and password
- Checks for duplicate users
- Returns JWT token on success
"

# Another standard task
git commit -m "fix(08-02): correct email validation regex

- Fixed regex to accept plus-addressing
- Added tests for edge cases
"
```

**Note:** TDD plans have their own commit pattern (test/feat/refactor for RED/GREEN/REFACTOR phases). See `<tdd_plan_execution>` section above.

**5. Record commit hash:**

After committing, capture hash for SUMMARY.md:

```bash
TASK_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
echo "Task ${TASK_NUM} committed: ${TASK_COMMIT}"
```

Store in array or list for SUMMARY generation:
```bash
TASK_COMMITS+=("Task ${TASK_NUM}: ${TASK_COMMIT}")
```

</task_commit>

<step name="verification_failure_gate">
If any task verification fails:

STOP. Do not continue to next task.

Present inline:
"Verification failed for Task [X]: [task name]

Expected: [verification criteria]
Actual: [what happened]

How to proceed?

1. Retry - Try the task again
2. Skip - Mark as incomplete, continue
3. Stop - Pause execution, investigate"

Wait for user decision.

If user chose "Skip", note it in SUMMARY.md under "Issues Encountered".
</step>

<step name="record_completion_time">
Record execution end time and calculate duration:

```bash
PLAN_END_TIME=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
PLAN_END_EPOCH=$(date +%s)

DURATION_SEC=$(( PLAN_END_EPOCH - PLAN_START_EPOCH ))
DURATION_MIN=$(( DURATION_SEC / 60 ))

if [[ $DURATION_MIN -ge 60 ]]; then
  HRS=$(( DURATION_MIN / 60 ))
  MIN=$(( DURATION_MIN % 60 ))
  DURATION="${HRS}h ${MIN}m"
else
  DURATION="${DURATION_MIN} min"
fi
```

Pass timing data to SUMMARY.md creation.
</step>

<step name="generate_user_setup">
**Generate USER-SETUP.md if plan has user_setup in frontmatter.**

Check PLAN.md frontmatter for `user_setup` field:

```bash
grep -A 50 "^user_setup:" .planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md | head -50
```

**If user_setup exists and is not empty:**

Create `.planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-USER-SETUP.md` using template from `~/.claude/get-shit-done/templates/user-setup.md`.

**Content generation:**

1. Parse each service in `user_setup` array
2. For each service, generate sections:
   - Environment Variables table (from `env_vars`)
   - Account Setup checklist (from `account_setup`, if present)
   - Dashboard Configuration steps (from `dashboard_config`, if present)
   - Local Development notes (from `local_dev`, if present)
3. Add verification section with commands to confirm setup works
4. Set status to "Incomplete"

**Example output:**

```markdown
# Phase 10: User Setup Required

**Generated:** 2025-01-14
**Phase:** 10-monetization
**Status:** Incomplete

## Environment Variables

| Status | Variable | Source | Add to |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| [ ] | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe Dashboard → Developers → API keys → Secret key | `.env.local` |
| [ ] | `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → Signing secret | `.env.local` |

## Dashboard Configuration

- [ ] **Create webhook endpoint**
  - Location: Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint
  - Details: URL: https://[your-domain]/api/webhooks/stripe, Events: checkout.session.completed

## Local Development

For local testing:
\`\`\`bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
\`\`\`

## Verification

[Verification commands based on service]

---
**Once all items complete:** Mark status as "Complete"
```

**If user_setup is empty or missing:**

Skip this step - no USER-SETUP.md needed.

**Track for offer_next:**

Set `USER_SETUP_CREATED=true` if file was generated, for use in completion messaging.
</step>

<step name="create_summary">
Create `{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md` as specified in the prompt's `<output>` section.
Use ~/.claude/get-shit-done/templates/summary.md for structure.

**File location:** `.planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md`

**Frontmatter population:**

Before writing summary content, populate frontmatter fields from execution context:

1. **Basic identification:**
   - phase: From PLAN.md frontmatter
   - plan: From PLAN.md frontmatter
   - subsystem: Categorize based on phase focus (auth, payments, ui, api, database, infra, testing, etc.)
   - tags: Extract tech keywords (libraries, frameworks, tools used)

2. **Dependency graph:**
   - requires: List prior phases this built upon (check PLAN.md context section for referenced prior summaries)
   - provides: Extract from accomplishments - what was delivered
   - affects: Infer from phase description/goal what future phases might need this

3. **Tech tracking:**
   - tech-stack.added: New libraries from package.json changes or requirements
   - tech-stack.patterns: Architectural patterns established (from decisions/accomplishments)

4. **File tracking:**
   - key-files.created: From "Files Created/Modified" section
   - key-files.modified: From "Files Created/Modified" section

5. **Decisions:**
   - key-decisions: Extract from "Decisions Made" section

6. **Metrics:**
   - duration: From $DURATION variable
   - completed: From $PLAN_END_TIME (date only, format YYYY-MM-DD)

Note: If subsystem/affects are unclear, use best judgment based on phase name and accomplishments. Can be refined later.

**Title format:** `# Phase [X] Plan [Y]: [Name] Summary`

The one-liner must be SUBSTANTIVE:

- Good: "JWT auth with refresh rotation using jose library"
- Bad: "Authentication implemented"

**Include performance data:**

- Duration: `$DURATION`
- Started: `$PLAN_START_TIME`
- Completed: `$PLAN_END_TIME`
- Tasks completed: (count from execution)
- Files modified: (count from execution)

**Next Step section:**

- If more plans exist in this phase: "Ready for {phase}-{next-plan}-PLAN.md"
- If this is the last plan: "Phase complete, ready for transition"
</step>

<step name="update_current_position">
Update Current Position section in STATE.md to reflect plan completion.

**Format:**

```markdown
Phase: [current] of [total] ([phase name])
Plan: [just completed] of [total in phase]
Status: [In progress / Phase complete]
Last activity: [today] - Completed {phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md

Progress: [progress bar]
```

**Calculate progress bar:**

- Count total plans across all phases (from ROADMAP.md or ROADMAP.md)
- Count completed plans (count SUMMARY.md files that exist)
- Progress = (completed / total) × 100%
- Render: ░ for incomplete, █ for complete

**Example - completing 02-01-PLAN.md (plan 5 of 10 total):**

Before:

```markdown
## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (Authentication)
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2025-01-18 - Phase 1 complete

Progress: ██████░░░░ 40%
```

After:

```markdown
## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (Authentication)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2025-01-19 - Completed 02-01-PLAN.md

Progress: ███████░░░ 50%
```

**Step complete when:**

- [ ] Phase number shows current phase (X of total)
- [ ] Plan number shows plans complete in current phase (N of total-in-phase)
- [ ] Status reflects current state (In progress / Phase complete)
- [ ] Last activity shows today's date and the plan just completed
- [ ] Progress bar calculated correctly from total completed plans
</step>

<step name="extract_decisions_and_issues">
Extract decisions, issues, and concerns from SUMMARY.md into STATE.md accumulated context.

**Decisions Made:**

- Read SUMMARY.md "## Decisions Made" section
- If content exists (not "None"):
  - Add each decision to STATE.md Decisions table
  - Format: `| [phase number] | [decision summary] | [rationale] |`

**Blockers/Concerns:**

- Read SUMMARY.md "## Next Phase Readiness" section
- If contains blockers or concerns:
  - Add to STATE.md "Blockers/Concerns Carried Forward"
</step>

<step name="update_session_continuity">
Update Session Continuity section in STATE.md to enable resumption in future sessions.

**Format:**

```markdown
Last session: [current date and time]
Stopped at: Completed {phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md
Resume file: [path to .continue-here if exists, else "None"]
```

**Size constraint note:** Keep STATE.md under 150 lines total.

**If more plans remain in this phase:**

- Update plan count: "2/3 plans complete"
- Keep phase status as "In progress"

**If this was the last plan in the phase:**

- Mark phase complete: status → "Complete"
- Add completion date
</step>

<step name="git_commit_metadata">
Commit execution metadata (SUMMARY + STATE + ROADMAP):

**Note:** All task code has already been committed during execution (one commit per task).
PLAN.md was already committed during plan-phase. This final commit captures execution results only.

**Check planning config:**

If `COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=false` (set in load_project_state):
- Skip all git operations for .planning/ files
- Planning docs exist locally but are gitignored
- Log: "Skipping planning docs commit (commit_docs: false)"
- Proceed to next step

If `COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=true` (default):
- Continue with git operations below

**1. Stage execution artifacts:**

```bash
git add .planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md
git add .planning/STATE.md
```

**2. Stage roadmap:**

```bash
git add .planning/ROADMAP.md
```

**3. Verify staging:**

```bash
git status
# Should show only execution artifacts (SUMMARY, STATE, ROADMAP), no code files
```

**4. Commit metadata:**

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

Tasks completed: 3/3
- User registration endpoint
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Email confirmation flow

SUMMARY: .planning/phases/08-user-auth/08-02-registration-SUMMARY.md

def456g feat(08-02): add email confirmation flow
hij789k feat(08-02): implement password hashing with bcrypt
lmn012o feat(08-02): create user registration endpoint
```

Each task has its own commit, followed by one metadata commit documenting plan completion.

See `git-integration.md` (loaded via required_reading) for commit message conventions.
</step>

<step name="update_codebase_map">
**If .planning/codebase/ exists:**

Check what changed across all task commits in this plan:

```bash
# Find first task commit (right after previous plan's docs commit)
FIRST_TASK=$(git log --oneline --grep="feat({phase}-{plan}):" --grep="fix({phase}-{plan}):" --grep="test({phase}-{plan}):" --reverse | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f1)

# Get all changes from first task through now
git diff --name-only ${FIRST_TASK}^..HEAD 2>/dev/null
```

**Update only if structural changes occurred:**

| Change Detected | Update Action |
|-----------------|---------------|
| New directory in src/ | STRUCTURE.md: Add to directory layout |
| package.json deps changed | STACK.md: Add/remove from dependencies list |
| New file pattern (e.g., first .test.ts) | CONVENTIONS.md: Note new pattern |
| New external API client | INTEGRATIONS.md: Add service entry with file path |
| Config file added/changed | STACK.md: Update configuration section |
| File renamed/moved | Update paths in relevant docs |

**Skip update if only:**
- Code changes within existing files
- Bug fixes
- Content changes (no structural impact)

**Update format:**
Make single targeted edits - add a bullet point, update a path, or remove a stale entry. Don't rewrite sections.

```bash
git add .planning/codebase/*.md
git commit --amend --no-edit  # Include in metadata commit
```

**If .planning/codebase/ doesn't exist:**
Skip this step.
</step>

<step name="offer_next">
**MANDATORY: Verify remaining work before presenting next steps.**

Do NOT skip this verification. Do NOT assume phase or milestone completion without checking.

**Step 0: Check for USER-SETUP.md**

If `USER_SETUP_CREATED=true` (from generate_user_setup step), always include this warning block at the TOP of completion output:

```
⚠️ USER SETUP REQUIRED

This phase introduced external services requiring manual configuration:

📋 .planning/phases/{phase-dir}/{phase}-USER-SETUP.md

Quick view:
- [ ] {ENV_VAR_1}
- [ ] {ENV_VAR_2}
- [ ] {Dashboard config task}

Complete this setup for the integration to function.
Run `cat .planning/phases/{phase-dir}/{phase}-USER-SETUP.md` for full details.

---
```

This warning appears BEFORE "Plan complete" messaging. User sees setup requirements prominently.

**Step 1: Count plans and summaries in current phase**

List files in the phase directory:

```bash
ls -1 .planning/phases/[current-phase-dir]/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
ls -1 .planning/phases/[current-phase-dir]/*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

State the counts: "This phase has [X] plans and [Y] summaries."

**Step 2: Route based on plan completion**

Compare the counts from Step 1:

| Condition | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| summaries < plans | More plans remain | Go to **Route A** |
| summaries = plans | Phase complete | Go to Step 3 |

---

**Route A: More plans remain in this phase**

Identify the next unexecuted plan:
- Find the first PLAN.md file that has no matching SUMMARY.md
- Read its `<objective>` section

<if mode="yolo">
```
Plan {phase}-{plan} complete.
Summary: .planning/phases/{phase-dir}/{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md

{Y} of {X} plans complete for Phase {Z}.

⚡ Auto-continuing: Execute next plan ({phase}-{next-plan})
```

Loop back to identify_plan step automatically.
</if>

<if mode="interactive" OR="custom with gates.execute_next_plan true">
```
Plan {phase}-{plan} complete.
Summary: .planning/phases/{phase-dir}/{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md

## ▶ Next Up

**{phase}-{next-plan}: [Plan Name]** — [objective from next PLAN.md]

`/gsd:execute-phase {phase}`

---

**Also available:**
- `/gsd:verify-work {phase}-{plan}` — manual acceptance testing before continuing
- Review what was built before continuing

---
```

Wait for user to clear and run next command.
</if>

**STOP here if Route A applies. Do not continue to Step 3.**

---

**Step 3: Check milestone status (only when all plans in phase are complete)**

Read ROADMAP.md and extract:
1. Current phase number (from the plan just completed)
2. All phase numbers listed in the current milestone section

To find phases in the current milestone, look for:
- Phase headers: lines starting with `### Phase` or `#### Phase`
- Phase list items: lines like `- [ ] **Phase X:` or `- [x] **Phase X:`

Count total phases in the current milestone and identify the highest phase number.

State: "Current phase is {X}. Milestone has {N} phases (highest: {Y})."

**Step 4: Route based on milestone status**

| Condition | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| current phase < highest phase | More phases remain | Go to **Route B** |
| current phase = highest phase | Milestone complete | Go to **Route C** |
