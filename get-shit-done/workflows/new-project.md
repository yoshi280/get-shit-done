<purpose>
Initialize a new project through unified flow: questioning, research (optional), requirements, roadmap. This is the most leveraged moment in any project — deep questioning here means better plans, better execution, better outcomes. One workflow takes you from idea to ready-for-planning.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.
</required_reading>

<auto_mode>
## Auto Mode Detection

Check if `--auto` flag is present in $ARGUMENTS.

**If auto mode:**
- Skip brownfield mapping offer (assume greenfield)
- Skip deep questioning (extract context from provided document)
- Config: YOLO mode is implicit (skip that question), but ask depth/git/agents FIRST (Step 2a)
- After config: run Steps 6-9 automatically with smart defaults:
  - Research: Always yes
  - Requirements: Include all table stakes + features from provided document
  - Requirements approval: Auto-approve
  - Roadmap approval: Auto-approve

**Document requirement:**
Auto mode requires an idea document — either:
- File reference: `/gsd:new-project --auto @prd.md`
- Pasted/written text in the prompt

If no document content provided, error:

```
Error: --auto requires an idea document.

Usage:
  /gsd:new-project --auto @your-idea.md
  /gsd:new-project --auto [paste or write your idea here]

The document should describe what you want to build.
```
</auto_mode>

<process>

## 1. Setup

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP — Execute these checks before ANY user interaction:**

```bash
INIT=$(node ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs init new-project)
```

Parse JSON for: `researcher_model`, `synthesizer_model`, `roadmapper_model`, `commit_docs`, `project_exists`, `has_codebase_map`, `planning_exists`, `has_existing_code`, `has_package_file`, `is_brownfield`, `needs_codebase_map`, `has_git`.

**If `project_exists` is true:** Error — project already initialized. Use `/gsd:progress`.

**If `has_git` is false:** Initialize git:
```bash
git init
```

## 2. Brownfield Offer

**If auto mode:** Skip to Step 4 (assume greenfield, synthesize PROJECT.md from provided document).

**If `needs_codebase_map` is true** (from init — existing code detected but no codebase map):

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Codebase"
- question: "I detected existing code in this directory. Would you like to map the codebase first?"
- options:
  - "Map codebase first" — Run /gsd:map-codebase to understand existing architecture (Recommended)
  - "Skip mapping" — Proceed with project initialization

**If "Map codebase first":**
```
Run `/gsd:map-codebase` first, then return to `/gsd:new-project`
```
Exit command.

**If "Skip mapping" OR `needs_codebase_map` is false:** Continue to Step 3.

## 2a. Auto Mode Config (auto mode only)

**If auto mode:** Collect config settings upfront before processing the idea document.

YOLO mode is implicit (auto = YOLO). Ask remaining config questions:

**Round 1 — Core settings (3 questions, no Mode question):**

```
AskUserQuestion([
  {
    header: "Depth",
    question: "How thorough should planning be?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Quick (Recommended)", description: "Ship fast (3-5 phases, 1-3 plans each)" },
      { label: "Standard", description: "Balanced scope and speed (5-8 phases, 3-5 plans each)" },
      { label: "Comprehensive", description: "Thorough coverage (8-12 phases, 5-10 plans each)" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Execution",
    question: "Run plans in parallel?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Parallel (Recommended)", description: "Independent plans run simultaneously" },
      { label: "Sequential", description: "One plan at a time" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Git Tracking",
    question: "Commit planning docs to git?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Planning docs tracked in version control" },
      { label: "No", description: "Keep .planning/ local-only (add to .gitignore)" }
    ]
  }
])
```

**Round 2 — Workflow agents (same as Step 5):**

```
AskUserQuestion([
  {
    header: "Research",
    question: "Research before planning each phase? (adds tokens/time)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Investigate domain, find patterns, surface gotchas" },
      { label: "No", description: "Plan directly from requirements" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Plan Check",
    question: "Verify plans will achieve their goals? (adds tokens/time)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Catch gaps before execution starts" },
      { label: "No", description: "Execute plans without verification" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Verifier",
    question: "Verify work satisfies requirements after each phase? (adds tokens/time)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Confirm deliverables match phase goals" },
      { label: "No", description: "Trust execution, skip verification" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Specialists",
    question: "Run specialist analysis before planning? (adds tokens/time)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Domain-specific analysis (data structures, performance, etc.)" },
      { label: "No", description: "Plan without specialist input" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "AI Models",
    question: "Which AI models for planning agents?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Balanced (Recommended)", description: "Sonnet for most agents — good quality/cost ratio" },
      { label: "Quality", description: "Opus for research/roadmap — higher cost, deeper analysis" },
      { label: "Budget", description: "Haiku where possible — fastest, lowest cost" }
    ]
  }
])
```

Create `.planning/config.json` with mode set to "yolo":

```json
{
  "mode": "yolo",
  "depth": "[selected]",
  "parallelization": true|false,
  "commit_docs": true|false,
  "model_profile": "quality|balanced|budget",
  "workflow": {
    "research": true|false,
    "plan_check": true|false,
    "verifier": true|false,
    "specialists": true|false,
    "auto_advance": true
  }
}
```

**If commit_docs = No:** Add `.planning/` to `.gitignore`.

**Commit config.json:**

```bash
mkdir -p .planning
node ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs commit "chore: add project config" --files .planning/config.json
```

**Persist auto-advance to config (survives context compaction):**

```bash
node ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs config-set workflow.auto_advance true
```

Proceed to Step 4 (skip Steps 3 and 5).

## 3. Deep Questioning

**If auto mode:** Skip (already handled in Step 2a). Extract project context from provided document instead and proceed to Step 4.

**Display stage banner:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GSD ► QUESTIONING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Open the conversation:**

Ask inline (freeform, NOT AskUserQuestion):

"What do you want to build?"

Wait for their response. This gives you the context needed to ask intelligent follow-up questions.

**Follow the thread:**

Based on what they said, ask follow-up questions that dig into their response. Use AskUserQuestion with options that probe what they mentioned — interpretations, clarifications, concrete examples.

Keep following threads. Each answer opens new threads to explore. Ask about:
- What excited them
- What problem sparked this
- What they mean by vague terms
- What it would actually look like
- What's already decided

Consult `questioning.md` for techniques:
- Challenge vagueness
- Make abstract concrete
- Surface assumptions
- Find edges
- Reveal motivation

**Check context (background, not out loud):**

As you go, mentally check the context checklist from `questioning.md`. If gaps remain, weave questions naturally. Don't suddenly switch to checklist mode.

**Decision gate:**

When you could write a clear PROJECT.md, use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Ready?"
- question: "I think I understand what you're after. Ready to create PROJECT.md?"
- options:
  - "Create PROJECT.md" — Let's move forward
  - "Keep exploring" — I want to share more / ask me more

If "Keep exploring" — ask what they want to add, or identify gaps and probe naturally.

Loop until "Create PROJECT.md" selected.

## 4. Write PROJECT.md

**If auto mode:** Synthesize from provided document. No "Ready?" gate was shown — proceed directly to commit.

Synthesize all context into `.planning/PROJECT.md` using the template from `templates/project.md`.

**For greenfield projects:**

Initialize requirements as hypotheses:

```markdown
## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] [Requirement 1]
- [ ] [Requirement 2]
- [ ] [Requirement 3]

### Out of Scope

- [Exclusion 1] — [why]
- [Exclusion 2] — [why]
```

All Active requirements are hypotheses until shipped and validated.

**For brownfield projects (codebase map exists):**

Infer Validated requirements from existing code:

1. Read `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `STACK.md`
2. Identify what the codebase already does
3. These become the initial Validated set

```markdown
## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ [Existing capability 1] — existing
- ✓ [Existing capability 2] — existing
- ✓ [Existing capability 3] — existing

### Active

- [ ] [New requirement 1]
- [ ] [New requirement 2]

### Out of Scope

- [Exclusion 1] — [why]
```

**Key Decisions:**

Initialize with any decisions made during questioning:

```markdown
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| [Choice from questioning] | [Why] | — Pending |
```

**Last updated footer:**

```markdown
---
*Last updated: [date] after initialization*
```

Do not compress. Capture everything gathered.

**Commit PROJECT.md:**

```bash
mkdir -p .planning
node ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs commit "docs: initialize project" --files .planning/PROJECT.md
```

## 5. Workflow Preferences

**If auto mode:** Skip — config was collected in Step 2a. Proceed to Step 5.5.

**Check for global defaults** at `~/.gsd/defaults.json`. If the file exists, offer to use saved defaults:

```
AskUserQuestion([
  {
    question: "Use your saved default settings? (from ~/.gsd/defaults.json)",
    header: "Defaults",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Use saved defaults, skip settings questions" },
      { label: "No", description: "Configure settings manually" }
    ]
  }
])
```

If "Yes": read `~/.gsd/defaults.json`, use those values for config.json, and skip directly to **Commit config.json** below.

If "No" or `~/.gsd/defaults.json` doesn't exist: proceed with the questions below.

**Round 1 — Core workflow settings (4 questions):**

```
questions: [
  {
    header: "Mode",
    question: "How do you want to work?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "YOLO (Recommended)", description: "Auto-approve, just execute" },
      { label: "Interactive", description: "Confirm at each step" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Depth",
    question: "How thorough should planning be?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Quick", description: "Ship fast (3-5 phases, 1-3 plans each)" },
      { label: "Standard", description: "Balanced scope and speed (5-8 phases, 3-5 plans each)" },
      { label: "Comprehensive", description: "Thorough coverage (8-12 phases, 5-10 plans each)" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Execution",
    question: "Run plans in parallel?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Parallel (Recommended)", description: "Independent plans run simultaneously" },
      { label: "Sequential", description: "One plan at a time" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Git Tracking",
    question: "Commit planning docs to git?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Planning docs tracked in version control" },
      { label: "No", description: "Keep .planning/ local-only (add to .gitignore)" }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Round 2 — Workflow agents:**

These spawn additional agents during planning/execution. They add tokens and time but improve quality.

| Agent | When it runs | What it does |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **Researcher** | Before planning each phase | Investigates domain, finds patterns, surfaces gotchas |
| **Plan Checker** | After plan is created | Verifies plan actually achieves the phase goal |
| **Verifier** | After phase execution | Confirms must-haves were delivered |
| **Specialists** | Before planning each phase | Domain-specific analysis (data structures, performance, etc.) |

All recommended for important projects. Skip for quick experiments.

```
questions: [
  {
    header: "Research",
    question: "Research before planning each phase? (adds tokens/time)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Investigate domain, find patterns, surface gotchas" },
      { label: "No", description: "Plan directly from requirements" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Plan Check",
    question: "Verify plans will achieve their goals? (adds tokens/time)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Catch gaps before execution starts" },
      { label: "No", description: "Execute plans without verification" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Verifier",
    question: "Verify work satisfies requirements after each phase? (adds tokens/time)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [

      { label: "No", description: "Trust execution, skip verification" }
    ]
  },

    question: "Run specialist analysis before planning? (adds tokens/time)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Domain-specific analysis (data structures, performance, etc.)" },
      { label: "No", description: "Plan without specialist input" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "AI Models",
    question: "Which AI models for planning agents?",

      { label: "Balanced (Recommended)", description: "Sonnet for most agents — good quality/cost ratio" },
      { label: "Quality", description: "Opus for research/roadmap — higher cost, deeper analysis" },
      { label: "Budget", description: "Haiku where possible — fastest, lowest cost" }
    ]
  }
]
```

Create `.planning/config.json` with all settings:

```json
{
  "mode": "yolo|interactive",
  "depth": "quick|standard|comprehensive",
  "parallelization": true|false,
  "commit_docs": true|false,
  "model_profile": "quality|balanced|budget",
  "workflow": {
    "research": true|false,
    "plan_check": true|false,
    "verifier": true|false,
    "specialists": true|false
  }
}
```

**If commit_docs = No:**
- Set `commit_docs: false` in config.json
- Add `.planning/` to `.gitignore` (create if needed)

**If commit_docs = Yes:**
- No additional gitignore entries needed

**Commit config.json:**

```bash
node ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs commit "chore: add project config" --files .planning/config.json
```

**Note:** Run `/gsd:settings` anytime to update these preferences.

## 5.5. Resolve Model Profile

Use models from init: `researcher_model`, `synthesizer_model`, `roadmapper_model`.

## 6. Research Decision

**If auto mode:** Default to "Research first" without asking.

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Research"
- question: "Research the domain ecosystem before defining requirements?"
- options:
  - "Research first (Recommended)" — Discover standard stacks, expected features, architecture patterns
  - "Skip research" — I know this domain well, go straight to requirements

**If "Research first":**

Display stage banner:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GSD ► RESEARCHING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Researching [domain] ecosystem...
```

Create research directory:
```bash
mkdir -p .planning/research
```

**Determine milestone context:**

Check if this is greenfield or subsequent milestone:
- If no "Validated" requirements in PROJECT.md → Greenfield (building from scratch)
- If "Validated" requirements exist → Subsequent milestone (adding to existing app)

### 6.1. Dimension Selection

```bash
# Load global dims
GLOBAL_DIMS=$(ls ~/.claude/get-shit-done/dimensions/*.md 2>/dev/null)
# Load project dims (if any)
PROJECT_DIMS=$(ls .planning/dimensions/*.md 2>/dev/null)
```

For each .md file, extract frontmatter fields `name` and `short_description`. Parse each file's YAML frontmatter between the `---` delimiters using a bash loop or inline awk. Project dims override global dims on name collision (compare by `name` field value). Build a combined list: `AVAILABLE_DIMS` (array of objects with `name`, `short_description`, `source` (global|project), `prompt_body`).

Pre-select for new project research: `stack`, `features`, `architecture`, `pitfalls` (the 4 core dimensions).

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **header:** "Dimensions"
- **question:** "Which dimensions should researchers cover?\nClaude pre-selected the 4 core dimensions for new project research."
- **options:** One option per available dimension, formatted as `{name} -- {short_description}`. Mark pre-selected ones as the default selection. Add `Other -- add a custom dimension` as the last option.
- Allow multi-select (user toggles on/off).

Store the user's selections in `SELECTED_DIMS`.

**If no dimensions selected:** Skip research entirely (equivalent to "Skip research"). Continue to Step 7.

### 6.2. Custom Dimension (if "Other" selected)

If "Other" is in `SELECTED_DIMS`:

1. Use AskUserQuestion with header "New Dim" and question "Name for this custom dimension? (used as slug, e.g. performance-optimization)"
2. Use AskUserQuestion with header "Describe It" and question "What should the researcher investigate for this dimension? (brief description)"
3. Claude generates a kebab-case slug from the name.
4. Claude expands the brief description into a full research prompt body (10-15 lines), written in the same imperative style as the existing dimension files.
5. **Name collision check:** If slug matches an existing global dim `name`:
   - Use AskUserQuestion with header "Collision" and question "'{name}' matches an existing global dimension. Override it (your version replaces the global for this project) or use a different name?"
   - options: `Override -- use my custom version`, `Rename -- enter a different name`
   - If "Rename": repeat slug/name collection (step 1 above).
6. Write to `.planning/dimensions/{slug}.md` with full YAML frontmatter and prompt body:

```markdown
---
name: {slug}
short_description: {user's brief description}
tags: [custom]
suggested_project_types: [all]
---

{expanded research prompt body}
```

7. Add the new dimension to `SELECTED_DIMS` (replace "Other" entry).

### 6.3. Spawn Researchers

Display spawning indicator (one line per selected dimension):
```
◆ Spawning {N} researchers in parallel...
  → {dim_name} research
  [repeat for each selected dim]
```

For each dim in `SELECTED_DIMS`:
- If project-level file exists at `.planning/dimensions/{dim}.md`, use that. Otherwise use `~/.claude/get-shit-done/dimensions/{dim}.md`.
- Read the prompt body (strip YAML frontmatter between `---` delimiters).
- Derive output filename: uppercase the slug, replace `-` with `-` (e.g., `stack` → `STACK.md`, `best-practices` → `BEST-PRACTICES.md`).

Spawn N parallel gsd-project-researcher agents (one per selected dimension):

```
For each SELECTED_DIM in SELECTED_DIMS:
Task(prompt="First, read ~/.claude/agents/gsd-project-researcher.md for your role and instructions.

<research_type>
Project Research — {dim_name} dimension for [domain].
</research_type>

<milestone_context>
[greenfield OR subsequent]

Greenfield: Research the {dim_name} dimension for building [domain] from scratch.
Subsequent: Research the {dim_name} dimension for adding [target features] to an existing [domain] app. Don't re-research the existing system.
</milestone_context>

<dimension_body>
{prompt_body from dimension file}

```

After all N agents complete, collect the output files:
```bash
RESEARCH_FILES=$(ls .planning/research/*.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v SUMMARY.md)
```

Spawn synthesizer to create SUMMARY.md:

```
Task(prompt="

## 7. Define Requirements

Display stage banner:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GSD ► DEFINING REQUIREMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Load context:**

Read PROJECT.md and extract:
- Core value (the ONE thing that must work)
- Stated constraints (budget, timeline, tech limitations)
- Any explicit scope boundaries

**If research exists:** Read research/FEATURES.md and extract feature categories.

**If auto mode:**
- Auto-include all table stakes features (users expect these)
- Include features explicitly mentioned in provided document
- Auto-defer differentiators not mentioned in document
- Skip per-category AskUserQuestion loops
- Skip "Any additions?" question
- Skip requirements approval gate
- Generate REQUIREMENTS.md and commit directly

**Present features by category (interactive mode only):**

```
Here are the features for [domain]:

## Authentication
**Table stakes:**
- Sign up with email/password
- Email verification
- Password reset
- Session management

**Differentiators:**
- Magic link login
- OAuth (Google, GitHub)
- 2FA

**Research notes:** [any relevant notes]

---

## [Next Category]
...
```

**If no research:** Gather requirements through conversation instead.

Ask: "What are the main things users need to be able to do?"

For each capability mentioned:
- Ask clarifying questions to make it specific
- Probe for related capabilities
- Group into categories

**Scope each category:**

For each category, use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "[Category]" (max 12 chars)
- question: "Which [category] features are in v1?"
- multiSelect: true
- options:
  - "[Feature 1]" — [brief description]
  - "[Feature 2]" — [brief description]
  - "[Feature 3]" — [brief description]
  - "None for v1" — Defer entire category

Track responses:
- Selected features → v1 requirements
- Unselected table stakes → v2 (users expect these)
- Unselected differentiators → out of scope

**Identify gaps:**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Additions"
- question: "Any requirements research missed? (Features specific to your vision)"
- options:
  - "No, research covered it" — Proceed
  - "Yes, let me add some" — Capture additions

**Validate core value:**

Cross-check requirements against Core Value from PROJECT.md. If gaps detected, surface them.

**Generate REQUIREMENTS.md:**

Create `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` with:
- v1 Requirements grouped by category (checkboxes, REQ-IDs)
- v2 Requirements (deferred)
- Out of Scope (explicit exclusions with reasoning)
- Traceability section (empty, filled by roadmap)

**REQ-ID format:** `[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]` (AUTH-01, CONTENT-02)

**Requirement quality criteria:**

Good requirements are:
- **Specific and testable:** "User can reset password via email link" (not "Handle password reset")
- **User-centric:** "User can X" (not "System does Y")
- **Atomic:** One capability per requirement (not "User can login and manage profile")
- **Independent:** Minimal dependencies on other requirements

Reject vague requirements. Push for specificity:
- "Handle authentication" → "User can log in with email/password and stay logged in across sessions"
- "Support sharing" → "User can share post via link that opens in recipient's browser"

**Present full requirements list (interactive mode only):**

Show every requirement (not counts) for user confirmation:

```
## v1 Requirements

### Authentication
- [ ] **AUTH-01**: User can create account with email/password
- [ ] **AUTH-02**: User can log in and stay logged in across sessions
- [ ] **AUTH-03**: User can log out from any page

### Content
- [ ] **CONT-01**: User can create posts with text
- [ ] **CONT-02**: User can edit their own posts

[... full list ...]

---

Does this capture what you're building? (yes / adjust)
```

If "adjust": Return to scoping.

**Commit requirements:**

```bash
node ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs commit "docs: define v1 requirements" --files .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
```

## 8. Create Roadmap

Display stage banner:

Create roadmap:
1. Derive phases from requirements (don't impose structure)
2. Map every v1 requirement to exactly one phase
3. Derive 2-5 success criteria per phase (observable user behaviors)
4. Validate 100% coverage
5. Write files immediately (ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability)
6. Return ROADMAP CREATED with summary

**Handle roadmapper return:**

**If `## ROADMAP BLOCKED`:**
- Present blocker information
- Work with user to resolve
- Re-spawn when resolved

**If `## ROADMAP CREATED`:**

Read the created ROADMAP.md and present it nicely inline:

**If auto mode:** Skip approval gate — auto-approve and commit directly.

**CRITICAL: Ask for approval before committing (interactive mode only):**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Roadmap"
- question: "Does this roadmap structure work for you?"
- options:
  - "Approve" — Commit and continue
  - "Adjust phases" — Tell me what to change
  - "Review full file" — Show raw ROADMAP.md

**If "Approve":** Continue to commit.

**If "Adjust phases":**
- Get user's adjustment notes
- Re-spawn roadmapper with revision context:
  ```
  Task(prompt="
  <revision>
  User feedback on roadmap:
  [user's notes]

  Current ROADMAP.md: @.planning/ROADMAP.md

  Update the roadmap based on feedback. Edit files in place.
  Return ROADMAP REVISED with changes made.
  </revision>
  ", subagent_type="gsd-roadmapper", model="{roadmapper_model}", description="Revise roadmap")
  ```
- Present revised roadmap
- Loop until user approves

**If "Review full file":** Display raw `cat .planning/ROADMAP.md`, then re-ask.

**Commit roadmap (after approval or auto mode):**

```bash
node ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs commit "docs: create roadmap ([N] phases)" --files .planning/ROADMAP.md .planning/STATE.md .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
```
